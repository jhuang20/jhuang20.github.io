<h4>We need Bikes</h4>
<p>NYC is one of the most congested metropolises in the country, and congestion will only increase as the population of NYC increases. Public transit should be a focal point of future investments, but given the current pace of expansion, cannot be a focal point of short-term congestion alleviation.</p>
<p>In comes the <b>bike</b>. The bike takes up 95% less space than a car, has a carbon footprint a fraction the size of a car's, and is much safer for pedestrians to interact with in a mixed space. These three elements alone mean that cycling--when embraced by the general population--can reduce the amount of congestion in the road. Thus, as part of a sustainable, long-term urban policy, bike lanes should be built earnestly, and to an extremely safe standard such that even novice cyclists will feel comfortable. Unfortunately, this is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>With climate change affecting NYC and many other cities, it is important to utilize all available technologies to keep the Earth and our cities livable for future generations. Bike lanes and bikes may seem old fashioned, but the elements mentioned earlier make cycling sustainable and thus an important element of <b>sustainable urban policy</b></p>
<p>One part of fostering a sense of sustainable urban policy is expanding access to eco-friendly, clean, and safe alternatives to driving. In NYC, biking can be a large part of that future--particularly bike share and the expansion of protected bike lanes.
With CitiBike X Stuy(which is featured prominently in this blog), I aimed to provide free annual memberships to Stuyvesant students, and encourage them to use bikeshare as a last mile option and a way to increase transportation flexibility for students who lived in transit deserts like the LES, Astoria, etc.
While my efforts were admittedly not the most successful, in part due to legal regulations, the Stuyvesant SU continues to host Day Pass Distributions and Group Rides to provide students with a taste of bikeshare and biking in NYC.
</p>
<p>I also cover bike lane expansion and CitiBike expansion. These are controversial topics because of the predominating car culture that prevades even walking-friendly NYC. However, the need for <b>free parking</b> and the propensity of the DOT to prioritize <b>vehicular traffic flow</b> mean that bike infrastructure is far too often shoved to the side. Bike lanes <em>cannot</em> simply be lines in the ground; rather, they should be protected and seen as safe for any rider from 5 to 85, skilled or novice. It is only then that cycling will be truly safe.</p>
<h4>In this blog, we talk about...</h4>
<ol><li>The efforts at my alma mater, Stuyvesant High School, to introduce free bike share membership and increase bikeshare awareness for students and youth</li>
  <li>DOT bike share expansion plans</li>
  <li>DOT bike lane expansion</li>
  <li>Bike lane inadequacies</li>
  <li>Progress in the fight for livable streets</li>
  <li>...and criticize corruption/slow work</li>
</ol><p>Cycling may be just one part of sustainable urban policy, but it is surely an important one. Cycling can supplement other forms of public transportation, and reduce the congestion that makes riding a bus so unenjoyable. With the combined efforts of electeds and the community, we believe that a bikeshare and bike lane network can be built that will provide access to people of all ages and social classes. We believe that a city with more bike lanes will be a less congested, more sustainable, and more livable one.</p>
