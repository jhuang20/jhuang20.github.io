<h4>CitiBike will dramatically expand in the next 4 years!</h4>
<p>On Tuesday, July 16th, CitiBike(powered by Lyft), announced concrete plans for their $100 million expansion project announced last November. This finally clarified how CitiBike was going to expand access to more New Yorkers. The highly successful bikeshare system has long been criticized for not serving underrepresented and poorer populations within New York, instead choosing to invest in expansion within more "gentrified neighborhoods." Phase 3 of the CitiBike expansion will blanket all of Manhattan with CitiBike docks, and cover most of the West Bronx and Northern Queens. This expansion will make CitiBike the 3rd largest docked bike share system in the world, and this will finally reach densely populated, but poorer neighborhoods that could really use CitiBike.</p>
<p>The $100 million dollar expansion has been funded entirely via. private investment. Since Bloomberg's introduction of the CitiBike system, the City Government has refused to subsidize CitiBike, and even makes it pay for metered parking in the spaces it occupies. This goes against the fact that one CitiBike station takes up 5 parking spots, but provides 32 bicycles instead. Despite CitiBike's status as a world-class, modern, and sustainable form of public-transport, the Mayor has instead chosen to invest in a Ferry system--pouring $600 million into a system that, while admittedly reducing last-mile costs for some people who live in low-income communities, experiences 1/8 the average weekday ridership as CitiBike. With the most current expansion of the bike share system, over 300,000 low-income New Yorkers will gain access to a bike system that can reduce their last-mile commutes to subways or even replace their commute entirely. Despite the Mayor's supposedly "steadfast committment" to making New York one city, rather than two, the Mayor's Office has not done much to promote CitiBike and expand access to it with city money.</p>
<p>Over the next 4 years, Citibike will expand in the following regions:</p>
