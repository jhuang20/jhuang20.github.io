<p>CitiBike X Stuy, in a partnership with Motivate and CitiBike, has announced it's <b>seventh</b> day pass distribution of the 2018-2019 school year.
This day pass distribution is special because unlike other Distribution days, CitiBike ambassadors will be accompanying and leading the ride through Central
Park and the Upper West Side. Participants will recieve not just a day pass, but also a helmet, some free swag(a T-shirt?) perhaps, and a FREE NYC Bike Map.</p>

<p>The group ride will start from Central Park South and 6th Avenue, and take place on Sunday, July 28th at 1PM. Participants are welcome to bring friends and their own bike, if they would prefer.
The group ride will last about an hour, and we will go up from Central Park South to 100th street, and across the West Side to 120th Street and Grants Tomb. There will then be a photo op, and CitiBike
swag will be given out. The day passes can be used for the rest of the day, and below are some suggestions for rides to take <b>after</b> the group ride.</p>

<h4>Rides to take After The Group Ride!</h4>
<p><br>
1. Ride down from 120th Street down the West Side Bike Path(mainly car free route), all the way to South Ferry!<br>
2. Ride back the way we came and experience the West Drive of Central Park!<br>
3. Take Ride (2), and continue cycling down from 59th Street/Columbus Circle via. Broadway. Then, at Madison Square, turn onto 5th Avenue and go to Washington Square Park!
</p>
<p>We hope that you sign up for a fun-filled summer day! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ9K4N06lPpovcIFOBqoVbYrvavU9ToD3A1eYSmq-fveZ_0Q/viewform">Link for signing up</a></p>
