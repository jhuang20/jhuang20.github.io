On Sunday, July 28th, CitiBike X Stuy hosted its last group ride for the 2019-2020 year! 25 people signed up for the ride, and while turnout wasn't 100%, we still had a large enough group to get a great picture and enjoy riding around Central Park!

The group consisted of both experienced riders and new ones, and during the ride, our CitiBike ambassador assisted with teaching the new riders riding basics.

All in all, the ride was a rather sweaty one. The hills of Central Park are definitely harder to scale on a CitiBike, and for many first-time users, balancing on the bike proved to be hard. We did one loop of the park, as shown on the map above, and when we were moving, the ride was extremely enjoyable.

Thanks to our CitiBike ambassador, we could take out CitiBikes for as long as possible-- and we did! We spent 2 hours riding around the loop at a very leisurely pace. At the end of the ride, participants recieved a CitiBike day pass to use anytime this year!<br>
It is my hope that in the following year, under the leadership of the SU and Vishwaa Sofat, that group rides and day pass distribution will continue.
