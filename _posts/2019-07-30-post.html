On Sunday, July 28th, CitiBike X Stuy hosted its last group ride for the 2019-2020 year! 25 people signed up for the ride, and while turnout wasn't 100%, we still had a large enough group to get a great picture and enjoy riding around Central Park!

The group consisted of both experienced riders and new ones, and during the ride, our CitiBike ambassador assisted with teaching the new riders riding basics.
